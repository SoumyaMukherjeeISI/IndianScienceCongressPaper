# IndianScienceCongressPaper
This is the github repository for the paper and relevant administrative materials related to paper titled “Minimum Sample Size required for Asymptotic Convergence to Normality” (Soumya Mukherjee, jointly with Swaraj Bose, Subhadeep Chaudhuri and Suraj Maiti) at the 105th Indian Science Congress held at Imphal, Manipur. The paper was completed in the period Aug 2017- Jan 2018 and selected for Poster presentation at the Indian Science Congress that year. Unfortunately we could not present our paper in person as the event was originally scheduled to be held at Hyderabad in Decemeber, but was later postponed and shifted to Manipur.
